## Download on the Google Chrome Web Store

The extension has been submitted for the Chrome Web Store but is currently in the audit state. I'll add a link here as soon as it's been published.

## Why the application was created

The extension was created because a friend's organization provides voluntary web seminars for old people. The organization needs to prove this to the sponsors. It's a German organization.

## Limitations

- This extension only works on https://meet.jit.si right now.
- Currently, the extension is only available in German translation. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
